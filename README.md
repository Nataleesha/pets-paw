## Pet Paws

An adaptive React [app](https://petspaw-two.vercel.app/) about cats, based on [cats API](https://thecatapi.com/).

### Local installation:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
In order to run the code correctly locally you need to get your api key at [cats API](https://thecatapi.com/). Create a ```.env``` file in the root of your project and insert your api key in the following format:
```
VITE_API_KEY=your_api_key
```
